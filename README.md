# Employee Management System - Assignment Submission

This repository contains the submission for two assignments: a project assignment and a DevOps pipeline assignment. The project assignment focuses on developing an Employee Management System application using ASP.NET Core MVC, Visual Studio, GitHub, and SQLite. The DevOps pipeline assignment aims to demonstrate the implementation of a comprehensive DevOps pipeline to enhance the development process.

## Project Overview

The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to manage employee data within an organization. It provides features such as employee registration, profile management, and data visualization. The application is built using ASP.NET Core MVC framework and utilizes a SQLite database for data storage.
